This is what you need to do for each project

Think of a problem that's interesting for you and find a dataset for that
Describe this problem and explain how a model could be used
Prepare the data and doing EDA, analyze important features
Train multiple models, tune their performance and select the best model
Export the notebook into a script
Put your model into a web service and deploy it locally with Docker
Bonus points for deploying the service to the cloud
